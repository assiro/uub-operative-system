Beta Test 0.2\r\n•\t Implementation of “patching” program for UUB - updating firmware and upgrading software\r\n\r\n•\tCustom commands definition for settings and functions\r\n\r\n•\tUart-lite (gps uart) device tree problem resolved\r\n\r\n•\tImplementation programs using D.Nitz’s trigger (G.Marsella)\r\n\r\n•\tBugs fixed in some scripts\r\n\r\n•\tSilicon PM control program implemented\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n- UBI sub-system implemented and works!\r\n- Bitstream FPGA by D.Nitz (fpga.bit) \r\n\r\n- Device tree with USB, I2C, SPI, UART, AXI Uartlite\r\n\r\n- Applications implemented:\r\n\r\n Name ----- contents ---- Author\r\n- scope - Real time monitor of input signals 10 channels (R. Assiro)\r\n- led continus led shot (R.Assiro)\r\n- led_dac Intensity of lef shot (R.Assiro)\r\n- acquire UUB real time data acquisition (G.Marsella R.Sato)\r\n- uub_init UUB devices intialization (R. Assiro)\r\n- slowc comunication program and control from zynq and MPS450 (K.H.Beker)\r\n- uub_init initialization of UUB at boot (R.Assiro)\r\n- ssd_test Test, acquisition and settings for SSD detector (D. Martello)\r\n- pmt_hv High voltage control (D. Martello)\r\n- trigger setup and control of trigger (D. Nitz) developing (G. Marsella)\r\n\r\nAll source code are available under SDK's workspace of uub-firmware (platform for developing software)\r\n\t\r\nInitialization of UUB's devices automatically at boot\r\n\r\nUBI is working fine! To upgrade the system and bitstream is easy like to copy a file\r\n\t\r\nWeb server: works!\r\n\r\nUSB: works!\r\n\r\nSPI0, SPI1, I2C0, I2C1: work!\r\nUart-lite is working\r\n\r\nTCF Agent for SDK development and cross-compiling enabled\r\n\r\nMore info to: http://elettronica.le.infn.it/?page_id=898\r\n\r\nlogin: root - passwd: root\r\n\r\nMAC address: 00:0A:35:00:1E:53 - DHCP active\r\n\r\nserial console speed: 9600 baud\r\n\r\nFor any questions: roberto.assiro@le.infn.it\r\n\r\n\r\n",
